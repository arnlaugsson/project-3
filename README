Part 3 (of 3) in the Compiler project.
This project was developed for an introduction to
Compilers course, taught at the Reykjavik
University in the spring of 2010.

The project is threefold:
	1 - Create a lexical analyzer for a subset of
		the Pascal programming language.
	2 - Create a parser to parse input files according
		to the given BNF grammar.
	3 - Create a TAC (Three Address Code) generator.
